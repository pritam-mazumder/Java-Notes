/*
    Generics:

     - Java Generics is one of the most important features introduced in Java 5
     - It allows to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types of data. Like:
        - Generics Class
        - Generic Interface
        - Generic Method

    Advantage:

    1. Type-safety:
        - We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn't allow to store other objects.
    2. Type casting is not required:
        - There is no need to typecast the object.
    3. Compile-Time Checking:
        - It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime.
        - The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.
