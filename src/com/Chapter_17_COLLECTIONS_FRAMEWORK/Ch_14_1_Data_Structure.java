    DATA STRUCTURE IN JAVA:

    Data structure is a way by which we can store the data in an "efficient way" (space and time complexity).

    Types of data structures:

    1. Primitive Data Structure:
       Primitive data are system-defined and contains only single values and have no special capabilities.
    2. Non-Primitive Data Structure:
       Non-primitive data types are user-defined data types (except for String class) and they can be easily created or modified by the users.
       They can be used to store multiple values and invoke methods to perform certain operations.


        - Primitive data structure:
            - char
            - boolean
            - float, double
            - byte, short, int, long

        - Non-primitive data Structures:
            - Linear Data Structures
                - String
                - Arrays
                    - Single dimensional Array
                    - Multidimensional Array
                - Stack
                - Queue
                - Linked List
                    - Singly-linked list
                    - Doubly Linked list
                    - Circular Linked List

            - Non-linear Data Structures
                - Trees
                    - Binary Tree
                    - Binary Search Tree
                    - AVL Tree
                    - Red-Black Tree
                - Graph
                - Heap
                    - MaxHeap
                    - MinHeap
                - Hash
                    - HashSet
                    - HashMap


    Followings are few commonly used collections in java:

    1. ArrayList:   For variable size collection
    2. Set:         For distinct collection
    3. Stack:       A LIFO data structure
    4. HashMap:     For storing key-value pairs
