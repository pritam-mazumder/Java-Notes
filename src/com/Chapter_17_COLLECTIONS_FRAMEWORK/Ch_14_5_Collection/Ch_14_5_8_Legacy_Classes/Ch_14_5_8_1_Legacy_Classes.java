    Legacy Classes:

    JDK 1.0:
        In this version java provides classes and interfaces
        in which we can store the data/objects, like:
            - Vector
            - Stack
            - Hashtable
            - Properties
            - Dictionary

    JDK 1.1:
        In this version collection framework was introduced.

    Classes and interfaces that formed the collections framework
    in the older version of Java
    are known as Legacy classes.

    All legacy classes are synchronized
