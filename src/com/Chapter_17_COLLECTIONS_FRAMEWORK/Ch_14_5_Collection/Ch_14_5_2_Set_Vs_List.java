/*
    LIST (List interface):

     - List is index based data structure.
     - It can store duplicate elements.
     - It can store multiple null value elements (allows duplicate elements).
     - It follows the insertion order. (order of insertion and retrieval are same)
     - We can iterate (get) the list elements by:
        - Iterator: getting elements in only in forward direction.
        - ListIterator: getting elements in forward as well as backward direction.


    SET (Set interface):

     - Set is hashcode based data structure. It stores the data according to the hashcode values.
     - It can not allow to store duplicate elements.
     - It can store only one null value element.
     - It does not follow the insertion order.
     - We can iterate the set elements by "Iterator" only.
