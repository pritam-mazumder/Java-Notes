/*
    ARRAY vs COLLECTION FRAMEWORK:

    Arrays:
     - Array can hold both primitive types(boolean, byte, short, int, long â€¦etc) and non-primitive (object)(using 'new' keyword) types.
     - Array can store only homogeneous (same) data. (in case of int array both int & char also be added).
     - Array size is fixed and cannot be changed at the runtime.
     - Arrays are inbuilt features in java, and thus we have to develop algorithms.
     - There is no utility methods in arrays.

    Collection Framework:
     - Collection can hold only non-primitive (object)(using 'new' keyword) types.
     - Collection can store heterogeneous (different) data.
     - Collections size is not fixed and can be changed at the runtime.
     - Collection framework is an API which provides predefined classes, interfaces and methods.
     - Every Collection provides utility methods.
