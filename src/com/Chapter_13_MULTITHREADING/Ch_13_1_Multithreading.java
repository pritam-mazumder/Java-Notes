    THREAD:

    A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process and also has separate paths of execution.
    It represents a sequence of instructions that can be scheduled for execution.
    The JVM allows an application
    to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.


    MULTITHREADING:

    The ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process.
    By utilizing multithreading, a program can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby improving performance and responsiveness.

    A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently
    and each part can handle a different task at the same time
    making optimal use of the available resources
    specially when your computer has multiple CPUs.

    Multi-tasking:      the ability of an operating system or computer system to execute multiple tasks concurrently.
    Multiprocessing:   it involves the use of multiple processors or cores in a computer system to execute tasks in parallel.
                        In a multi-processing system, each processor or core can handle its own set of instructions independently.
    Multi-threading:    it is a programming technique that enables concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.
    Multi-user:         a system that allows multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously.



    There are two ways to create threads:
    1. By extending Thread class and overriding its run() method
    2. By implementing runnable interface



    CONCURRENCY:
    The act of running and managing multiple computation at the same time.
        OR
    The ability to execute multiple tasks or processes in overlapping time intervals.

    PARALLELISM:
    The act of running multiple computation simultaneously.
        R
    It involves executing tasks simultaneously using multiple resources, such as multiple processors or processor cores.
