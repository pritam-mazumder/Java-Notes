    What is Java?

    Java is an object-oriented, class-based, high level, robust, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language.


    Application

     - Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
     - Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
     - Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
     - Mobile
     - Embedded System
     - Smart Card
     - Robotics
     - Games, etc.


    Java Architecture:

     - There is a process of compilation and interpretation.
     - Java compiler (javac) converts the Java code into byte code (.class).
     - After that, the JVM converts the byte code into machine code.
     - The machine code is then executed by the machine.


    Components of Java Architecture:

     - JVM - Java Virtual Machine
     - JRE - Java Runtime Environment
     - JDK - Java Development Kit


    JVM - Java Virtual Machine:

    ClassLoader:    It loads the bytecode in the main memory.
    Area:           Here the class data is stored during the code's execution.
    Execution Engine:
     - Interpreter:         It converts the byte code into native code and executes.
     - JIT Compiler:        JIT compiler is introduced to remove the drawback of the interpreter.
                            It increases the speed of execution and improves performance.
     - Garbage Collector:   The garbage collector is used to manage the memory, and it is a program written in Java.


    JRE - Java Runtime Environment:

    It provides an environment for the execution of Java programs.
    JRE takes our Java code, integrates it with the required libraries, and then starts the JVM to execute it.


    JDK - Java Development Kit:

    It is a software development environment used in the development of Java applications and applets.
    Java Development Kit holds JRE, a compiler, an interpreter or loader, and several development tools in it.
